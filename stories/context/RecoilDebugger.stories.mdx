# Recoil Debugger

Atomic provides you with a component for [debugging](https://recoiljs.org/docs/guides/dev-tools) Recoil's state;
provided are tools for inspecting, logging, and managing this state â€” all facilitated by [Recoil's Snapshot API](https://recoiljs.org/docs/api-reference/core/Snapshot).

### Example

```tsx
import { RecoilDebugger } from '@locktech/atomic'

const App = () => (
  <AtomicProvider>
    <RecoilDebugger />
    ...
  </AtomicProvider>
)
```

### Props

| Property     	      | Required     	| Default     	| Description                                           |
|-------------------- |--------------	|--------------	|-----------------------------------------------------	|
| `captureChanges`    | `false`     	| `true`        | `console.log` all changes to Recoil's state.          |
| `excludedKeys`      | `false`     	| `[]`          | Exclude atoms with these keys from debugging.         |
| `includedKeys`      | `false`      	| `undefined`  	| Include (only) atoms with these keys in debugging.   	|
| `storeSnapshots`    | `false`      	| `false`     	| Store every Snapshot the debugger encounters. 	      |

> `storeSnapshots` lacks implementation and, as of now, only serves to eat-up your application's memory.
