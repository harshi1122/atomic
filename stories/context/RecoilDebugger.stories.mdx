# Recoil Debugger

Atomic provides you with a component for [debugging](https://recoiljs.org/docs/guides/dev-tools) Recoil's state.
Provided are a number of tools for inspecting, logging, and managing this state — facilitated via [Snapshots](https://recoiljs.org/docs/api-reference/core/Snapshot).

```tsx
import { RecoilDebugger } from '@locktech/atomic'

const App = () => (
  <AtomicProvider>
    <RecoilDebugger />
    ...
  </AtomicProvider>
)
```

## Logging Changes

By default, the debugger will `console.log` every change which occurs to every [atom](https://recoiljs.org/docs/api-reference/core/atom) you or Atomic has registered with Recoil.
This can easily be toggled *off* using the `captureChanges` prop.

```tsx
// Details omitted for brevity
const App = () => (
  <RecoilDebugger captureChanges={false} />
)
```

### Filtering Changes


Sometimes, seeing every change can be overwhelming;
Atomic provides you with two props you may use to control which atoms are logged.

```tsx
const App = () => (
  <RecoilDebugger
    // Exclude atoms with these keys from logging.
    excludedKeys={['...']}
    // Include only atoms with these keys in logging.
    includedKeys={['...']}
  />
)
```

## Storing Snapshots

The debugger **can** keep track of *every* Snapshot it encounters — i.e., every Snapshot which occurs in your application.
Only [unique](https://recoiljs.org/docs/api-reference/core/Snapshot#snapshot-ids) Snapshots will be stored — helping to mitigate duplication.

```tsx
const App = () => (
  <RecoilDebugger storeSnapshots />
)
```
