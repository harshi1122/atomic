# Introduction

Out-of-the-box, Atomic supports two methods of representing global state in your application.

* [**Context API**](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) — React's API for sharing values throughout an application, without passing the value through props and callbacks.
* [**RecoilJS**](https://recoiljs.org/) — A state-management library for React; built with performance, asynchronous execution, derived state, and [more](https://recoiljs.org/docs/introduction/motivation) in mind.

> Most simple use-cases should use the `Context API`. It's built into React, provides a simple interface, and is used by Atomic in places Recoil would prove overkill.

This set of documents provides descriptions, examples, and APIs for functions and boilerplate provided by Atomic, centered around both the Context API and Recoil's.
