# Introduction

Out-of-the-box, Atomic supports two methods of representing global state in your application.

* [**Context API**](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) — React's API for sharing values throughout an application, without passing the value through props and callbacks.
* [**RecoilJS**](https://recoiljs.org/) — A state-management library for React; built with performance, asynchronous execution, derived state, [and more in mind](https://recoiljs.org/docs/introduction/motivation).

> Most simple use-cases should use the `Context API`. It's built into React, provides a simple interface, and is used by Atomic in places Recoil would prove overkill.

This set of documents provides descriptions, examples, and APIs for functions and boilerplate provided by Atomic, centered around both the Context API and Recoil's.

## Code Organization

Redwood carries with it strong opinionations regarding your application's directory structure.

To fit well with it, Atomic's recommendation is that you store global state in a directory aptly named `context`, at the root of the web-side's `src/` directory. You should use this directory to store both your application's contexts and atoms.
