# Getting Started

Atomic is purpose-built for the [RedwoodJS framework](https://redwoodjs.com), so this document will cover installation in terms of it.

### Installation

Let's start by installing Atomic to the *Web*-side of your application.

```bash
yarn workspace web add @locktech/atomic
```

> Atomic includes quite a few [third-party packages](?path=/story/guides-3rd-party-packages--page), which are installed and available for use in your application.

### Atomic-Provider

Once installed, Atomic's provider can be wrapped around your application's `<Routes />`.

`AtomicProvider` wraps the following, re-exposing and initalizing their APIs:

* `<RecoilRoot>` — [Setup Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/docs/introduction/getting-started#recoilroot) — making values stored in [Atom's](https://recoiljs.org/docs/basic-tutorial/atoms) available throughout your app.
* `<Normalize>` — Applies Atomic's CSS resets — setting up the foundation for Atomic's custom styles.
* `<CSSProvider>` — Configure [custom CSS properties](?path=/docs/customize-theming--page), used to theme components.
* `<Styler>` — Customize the [CSS properties and their values](?path=/docs/customize-styling--page) which define the low-level visual styling of components.

> Importing this component will also trigger [goober's setup](https://goober.js.org/api/setup), initalizing the library for use with React — zero configuration required.

> Atomic's provider **should** be added as a child of `RedwoodApolloProvider`.

```tsx
import { AtomicProvider } from '@locktech/atomic'
import { FatalErrorBoundary, RedwoodProvider } from '@redwoodjs/web'
import { RedwoodApolloProvider } from '@redwoodjs/web/apollo'

import FatalErrorPage from 'src/pages/FatalErrorPage'
import Routes from 'src/Routes'

import './index.css'

const App = () => (
  <FatalErrorBoundary page={FatalErrorPage}>
    <RedwoodProvider titleTemplate="%PageTitle | %AppTitle">
      <RedwoodApolloProvider>
        {/* Add and customize Atomic's provider */}
        <AtomicProvider normalize={...} properties={...} styler={...}>
          <Routes />
        </AtomicProvider>
      </RedwoodApolloProvider>
    </RedwoodProvider>
  </FatalErrorBoundary>
)

export default App
```

### Customization

Atomic supports customization using two distinct APIs. One of these APIs relies upon the other, and both have full support for custom values.

* [Theming](?path=/story/customize-theming--page) — Provides an assortment of CSS property values to be used by your application's styling to ensure a consistent experience.
* [Styling](?path=/story/customize-styling--page) — An extensible API for defining low-level styles using a CSS-in-JS pattern.
