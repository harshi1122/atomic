# Color Mode

Atomic provides first-class support for defining styles to be used in bright and dim lighting environments.
It also includes methods and hooks for swapping between them, respecting a user's preferred choice, and overwriting that preference.
Finally, these configurations will be persisted — loaded before an application to mitigate ["flashing"](https://css-tricks.com/flash-of-inaccurate-color-theme-fart/)
(see video in linked article) from one set of styles to the other.

## Global Values

When a user wants your application in dark-mode, it's safe to assume you'll want to set your typography's color to something which strongly contrasts the dark background.
Atomic provides custom CSS properties to fulfil this need — with many components relying upon the values listed below.

> These values are added by the `<CSSProvider>` component, or by it through `<AtomicProvider>`.

| Property     	| Bright                   	| Dim                    	|
|--------------	|--------------------------	|-----------------------	|
| `color.text` 	| `color.neutral.9`        	| `color.neutral.0`     	|
| `color.hint` 	| `color.neutral.6`        	| `color.neutral.3`     	|
