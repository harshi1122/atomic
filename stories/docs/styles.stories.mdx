# Styling

This document covers a few methods of styling your RedwoodJS application, providing you examples for integrating Atomic's functionality with each.

This document is *not* designed to cover each and every way in which you can style your application.
Instead, it focuses on methods which are inline with Atomic's philosophies — using tools and technologies available to you via it.

## Vanilla CSS

In most cases, it may be best to provide styling for your application using the `index.css` file.

Redwood supports bundling `*.css` files with your JavaScript, so you can scope styles to your cells, components, and pages to keep styles next to their implementations —
should you find your `index.css` file becoming unruly.

### Using Theme Values

Because Atomic stores its [theme](?path=/story/customize-theming--page) as [custom CSS properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*),
it's incredibly straightforward to access those values from within CSS.
As you might expect, any [application-specific properties](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/customize-theming--page#custom-values) you provide `AtomicProvider` will be available as custom properties.

```css
.my-class {
  background-color: var(--color-primary-8);
  color: var(--color-secondary-2);
}
```

To see a list of the available custom properties, use your [browser's dev-tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools)
to [inspect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_inspector_dom_explorer_and_css_editor) the `<html>` element.

Custom properties will be listed in the [CSS edtior](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools#exploring_the_css_editor).

> Some properties will only be shown when certain conditions are met — such as when breakpoints are triggered.

```css
:root {
  ...
  --color-success-9: #064E3B;
  --color-success-9-rgb: 6, 78, 59;
  --color-success-9-text: var(--color-neutral-0);
  --radius-none: none;
  --radius-xs: 0.125rem;
  --radius-sm: 0.25rem;
  --radius-md: 0.375rem;
  ...
}
```

## CSS-in-JS

CSS-in-JS is a: [styling technique where JavaScript is used to style components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS-in-JS).

It's used heavily by Atomic's components, and powers its [Styler](?path=/story/customize-styling--page) API.
Atomic uses [goober](https://goober.js.org/) — a [tiny](https://goober.rocks/the-great-shave-off) CSS-in-JS library — to do so efficiently, at the lowest possible cost to your application's bundle-size.

If you're a fan of — or are simply curious about — this pattern and would like to use it in your application, Atomic re-exports the key parts of goober's API.

* [css](https://goober.js.org/api/css)
* [styled](https://goober.js.org/api/styled)
* [createGlobalStyles](https://goober.js.org/api/createGlobalStyles)

Like any 3rd party library, you may still access goober's full API through its npm package.

> Atomic will take care of [setting up goober](https://goober.js.org/api/setup) for use in React.
