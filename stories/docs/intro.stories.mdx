Atomic is a library for building highly configurable, opinionated, and [accessible](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#aria_ex) user interfaces ‚Äî purpose-built for [RedwoodJS](http://redwoodjs.com/) applications.

It takes inspiration from existing solutions, such as: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), [Material Design](http://material.io/), and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

But, because it's specifically built to compliment the RedwoodJS framework, out-scopes its inspiration: providing ready-made decisions to form a complete stack with which web-based UIs can be built.

## üõë Stop: Let's Talk Jargon

Atomic relies heavily on the front-end JavaScript ecosystem ‚Äî words and phrases will be understandably peculiar if you're unfamiliar.

I add this message as an encouragement for you to do (responable) research on any phrase or tool you're unfamiliar with.

I've tried my best to explain things as experience-level friendly as I can ‚Äî but, I am human.
Please consider [starting a discussion](https://github.com/LockTech/atomic/discussions/new?category=q-a) if anything seems weird, un-understandable, or is out-right wrong ‚ù§Ô∏è
