# Styling Atomic

In addition to making [minor changes](?path=/story/atomic-theming--page) to Atomic's presentation, you also have the ability to fully customize the styles which dictate the low-level apperance of Atomic's components.

## Variables

Atomic relies heavily on CSS' [custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*).
When providing styles, you have the opportunity to define a few specific properties â€” whose value's will take effect under certain conditions.

* `bps` â€” Set the value of a custom CSS property depending on if the related breakpoint is being triggered.
* `color` â€” Specify a property values to be used for "bright" or "dim" lighting modes.

> Custom CSS property usage [mimics that of custom theme values](http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/customize-theming--page#usage).

## Styles

Component styles fall into two categories:

* `base` â€” Styles which will always be applied to a component, setting its default visual apperance.
* `variants` â€” Styles which will apply conditionally, depending on the presence of a dynamic value.
  * Components may define as many variants as they like, with each having as many variations as needed.
