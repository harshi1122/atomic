# Theming Atomic

Atomic provides two interfaces for customizing its components, styles, and provided properties.

This document covers the more generic, all-encompassing of the two: Theming.

## Customizing the Theme

The actually make customizations to the theme's properties, you must provide a value for the `theme` prop, added to the `AtomicProvider` component which wraps your application.

> **Note:** Customizing Atomic's theme is all-or-nothing: providing a value for the `theme` prop _completely_ overrides Atomic's.

<Source file="web/src/App.js" language="jsx">
{`import { AtomicProvider } from '@locktech/atomic'\n
const App = () => {
  return (
    <AtomicProvider
      theme={{
        color: { ... },
        space: { ... },
        ...
      }}
    >
      ...
    </AtomicProvider>
  )
}`}
</Source>

## Extending Atomic's Theme

The theme used by this documentation, and the one used after installing Atomic, can be merged with your application's using a convenience function, appropriately named `mergeAtomicTheme`.

<Source file="web/src/App.js" language="jsx">
{`import { AtomicProvider, mergeAtomicTheme } from '@locktech/atomic'\n
const App = () => {
  return (
    <AtomicProvider theme={mergeAtomicTheme({
      color: { ... },
      space: { ... },
      ...
    })}>
      ...
    </AtomicProvider>
  )
}`}
</Source>

If you'd like to merge two themes you've created, or perhaps merge a third with one already merged with Atomic's, you may use the `mergeThemes` function.

<Source file="web/src/theme.js" language="js">
{`import { mergeAtomicTheme, mergeTheme } from '@locktech/atomic'\n
const ThemeA = mergeAtomicTheme({ ... })
const ThemeB = mergeThemes(ThemeA, { ... })
const ThemeC = ...`}
</Source>

## Code Organization

Depending on how _much_ you need to customize Atomic, you may benefit from relocating your theme to a seperate file or set of files.

### Seperate File

Atomic's recommended approach is to start with a file, `theme.(js|ts)`, located alongside your application's `App.(js|tsx)`.

<!-- This idea is from Chakra-UI. I think it's too clever not to attribute. (where I got it) -->
```
📁 ...
  📁 api
  📂 web
    📁 public
    📂 src
      📁 components
      📁 ...
      📄 App.js
      📄 ...
      📄 theme.js
```

<Source file="web/src/theme.js" language="jsx">
{`import { mergeAtomicTheme } from '@locktech/atomic'\n
export const MyTheme = mergeAtomicTheme({ ... })`}
</Source>

<Source file="web/src/App.js" language="jsx">
{`import { MyTheme } from 'src/theme'\n
const App = () => {
  return (
    <AtomicProvider theme={MyTheme}>
      ...
    </AtomicProvider>
  )
}`}
</Source>

### Seperate Set of Files

If this `theme.js` file, too, becomes unruly — a `web/src/theme/` directory can be created, and your theme split amongst many files.

```
📁 ...
  📁 api
  📂 web
    📁 public
    📂 src
      📁 components
      📁 ...
      📂 theme
        📄 color.js
        📄 space.js
        📄 ...
        📄 MyTheme.js
      📄 App.js
      📄 ...
```

<Source file="web/src/theme/MyTheme.js" language="js">
{`import { mergeAtomicTheme } from '@locktech/atomic'\n
import { color } from 'src/theme/color'\n
export const MyTheme = mergeAtomicTheme({ color, ... })`}
</Source>

<Source file="web/src/App.js" language="jsx">
{`import { MyTheme } from 'src/theme/MyTheme'\n
const App = () => {
  return (
    <AtomicProvider theme={MyTheme}>
      ...
    </AtomicProvider>
  )
}`}
</Source>
